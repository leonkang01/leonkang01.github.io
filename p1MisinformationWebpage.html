				<h2>Case 1: Toilet Paper Scarcity</h2>
				<p>In Australia, the news wrongly reported that most of their toilet paper was imported from other countries,
				 with Covid-19 shutting down shipping around the world, Australians feared running out of toilet paper.
				Althought this was false (only around 40% being imported), people chose to buy as much toilet paper as they could 
				in case supply never went up again, this eventually spreading to other countries from a problem that was isolated only in Australia</p>

				<h2>Case 3: Crop Cycle Failiures</h2>
				<p>
				Due to isolation, jobs closing, and fears about going outside, people would spend a lot less in the Pandemic.
				Because of this farmers had to destroy tons and tons of food in fears of crops rotting on store shelves instead of being purchased.

				This cycle caused a whole lot of wasted food such as 3.7 million
